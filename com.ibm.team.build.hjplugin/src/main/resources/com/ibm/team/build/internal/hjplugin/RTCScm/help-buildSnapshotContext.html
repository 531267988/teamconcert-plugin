<div>
  <p>
	Specify the owner of the snapshot. A snapshot can be owned by either a repository workspace or a stream. 
	Specifying the owner of the snapshot enables scoped search and hence avoids duplicates in the search result.
  </p>
  <p>
	When you do not have the snapshot owner details or if you are certain that the snapshot name is unique in the repository, then you can choose "- none -" for the snapshot owner. 
	Snapshot owner details are ignored when you specify the UUID of the snapshot.
  </p>  
  <p>
  	When you choose "- none -" for the snapshot owner, the snapshot search is not scoped and happens across the repository.  
  </p>
  <p>
  	When a owning repository workspace or a stream is specified, the snapshot search is scoped to the snapshots associated with the specified repository workspace or stream.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When the snapshot owner is selected to be a repository workspace but the name of the repository workspace is not specified, 
  	then the snapshot search is not scoped and happens across the repository.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When the snapshot owner is selected to be a stream but neither the project or team area nor the owning stream is specified, 
  	then the snapshot search is not scoped and happens across the repository.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When the snapshot owner is selected to be a stream and only the project or team area name is specified, then the snapshot search is scoped 
  	to the snapshots associated with all streams owned by the specified project or team area.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When the snapshot owner is selected to be a stream and only the stream name is specified, then the snapshot search is scoped to the snapshots 
  	associated with all streams with the given name, across the repository.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When the snapshot owner is selected to be a stream and the name of the project or team area as well as the name of the owning stream is specified, then the snapshot search 
  	is scoped to the snapshots associated with all streams with the given name in the specified project or team area.
