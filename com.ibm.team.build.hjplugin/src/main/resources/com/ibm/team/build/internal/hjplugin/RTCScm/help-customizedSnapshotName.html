<div>
  <p>
  	Specifies the name given to the snapshot that is created after accepting the changes.
  </p>
  <p>
  	This field can be set to any user-specified string, referencing environment variables and build parameters. It is recommended to include at least one variable 
   	whose value is unique to each build, e.g. BUILD_NUMBER, BUILD_ID or BUILD_URL, in order to ensure that consecutive builds create snapshots with different names. 
	If this field is empty then a default snapshot name will be used instead. For jobs that use a Build Definition, the snapshot name defaults to "${buildDefinitionId}_#${BUILD_NUMBER}". 
	For jobs that use a Stream or a Repository Workspace, the snapshot name defaults to "${JOB_NAME}_#${BUILD_NUMBER}".
  </p>
  <p>
  	e.g. For a job named "JUnit Integration Build" if this field is set to "${JOB_NAME}_#${BUILD_NUMBER}_Snapshot", the name of the snapshot created by the first 
  	build would be "JUnit Integration Build_#1_Snapshot".
  </p>
