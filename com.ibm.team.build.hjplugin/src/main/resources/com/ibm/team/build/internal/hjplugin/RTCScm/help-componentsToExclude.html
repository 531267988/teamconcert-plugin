<div>
  <p>
   If only some components in the workspace will be built, you can exclude components that do not need to load.
  </p>
  <p>
  	To exclude components, list them in the following JSON format, save the list to a file on disk, and specify the path to the file in this field.
  </p>
  <p>
  <pre>
  {
    "componentsToExclude":[
      {
	    "componentName":"JUnit"
      },
      {
	    "componentName":"Releng"
      }
    ]
  }
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
  	You can also specify "componentId" instead of "componentName." The "componentId" is the item ID (UUID) of the component. 
  	If you specify both "componentName" and "componentId", the lookup occurs only by "componentId."
  </p>
