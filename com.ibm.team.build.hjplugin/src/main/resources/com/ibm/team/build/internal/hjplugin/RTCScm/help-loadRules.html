   Select a load rules file to specify how to load the build workspace. If Dynamic Load Rules were specified by using an extension, those rules take precedence over the ones specified here.
  </p>
  <p>
  	To apply load rules, list them in the following JSON format, save the list to a file on disk, and specify the path to the file in this field.
  </p>
  <p>
  <pre>
  {
    "loadRules":[
      {
        "componentName":"JUnit",
        "filePath":"JUnit Project/junit-project.loadrule"
      },
      {
        "componentName":"Releng",
        "filePath":"Releng Project/releng-project.loadrule"
      }
    ]
  }
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
	You can also specify "componentId" instead of "componentName." The "componentId" is the item ID (UUID) of the component. 
	If you specify both "componentName" and "componentId," the lookup occurs only by "componentId."
  </p>
  <p>
  	The "filePath" value is the full path to the load rule file in the repository; that is, the remote path. 
  	You can also specify "fileItemId" instead of "filePath." The "fileItemId" is the item ID (UUID) of the load rule file. 
  	When you specify the file path, use forward slashes (/) to separate the path segments. If you specify both "filePath" and "fileItemId," the lookup occurs only by "fileItemId."
  </p>
